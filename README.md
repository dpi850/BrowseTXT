## About BrowseTXT

`BrowseTXT` is a terminal-based web browser built for simplicity and efficiency. Instead of rendering complex web pages with images, videos, and scripts, it focuses on delivering the essential text content. This makes it ideal for quickly reading articles, documentation, or navigating through websites without the overhead of a full graphical browser. It intelligently extracts main content, removes extraneous elements like headers, footers, and scripts, and allows you to follow links and download files directly from your command line.

## Features

* **Text-focused Browse:** Strips out non-essential elements (scripts, styles, headers, footers, navigation, forms, asides) to provide a clean text view of web pages.
* **Intelligent Content Extraction:** Prioritizes `article` tags, content-related `div` elements, or `p` tags to find the main body of the text.
* **Terminal Integration:** Displays content directly in your terminal, wrapping text to 70% of your terminal's width for readability.
* **Link Navigation:** Automatically lists all accessible links on a page with numbered indices, allowing easy navigation using the `link <number>` command.
* **Navigation History:** Go back to previously visited pages using the `back` command.
* **File Downloading:** Download files directly to your system's `Downloads` directory with a progress indicator using the `download <url>` command.
* **Page Caching:** Caches recently visited pages for faster re-loading (5-minute TTL, max 10 pages).
* **User-Agent Spoofing:** Uses a common Firefox User-Agent to improve compatibility with websites.
* **Colorized Output:** Enhances readability with random color headers and distinct styling for links and messages using `colorama`.
